I made this blog when I first started doing HTML and modified it a bit. You could probably
get a much nicer design with blogspot/blogger/wordpress but that's not the point. :) If you're new, or even experienced with HTML/CSS, this blog gives a great starting point and you can customize
it as you wish. Ahem, blogspot/blogger/wordpress don't give you that freedom.

Anyway, feel free to do what you please with it! You don't have to link back to me (though if
you did, it would be very kind).

Have fun! Check out my website at razaahmed.com and blog at razaahmed.com/blog
